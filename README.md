I'm always eager to learn new languages and technologies to expand my toolkit and adapt to the needs of any project. But these are the languages I usually use for any project.

## üíº What I Do

- **Fullstack Development**: While I enjoy working across the stack, I have a particular affinity for backend development.
- **Clean Architecture & DX**: I'm a proponent of clean architecture and design patterns, ensuring maintainable and scalable codebases. I strive to enhance Developer Experience (DX) by creating intuitive and efficient development processes.
- **Idea Realization**: If I find an idea compelling, I dive deep to learn whatever is necessary to bring it to life.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment

- **Operating Systems**: Windows and Linux (dual-boot setup)
- **IDEs**: 
  - Visual Studio for large projects
  - Cursor and VSCode for smaller projects
  - JetBrains Rider for C# and .NET
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Hosting & Cloud**: Vercel, AWS, Azure
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, MongoDB

## üìö Continuous Learning

As a self-taught developer, I'm committed to continuous learning, especially in the field of software architecture. I'm always exploring new tools, languages, and methodologies to enhance my skills and bring innovative ideas to fruition. My focus on software architecture helps me design systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.
